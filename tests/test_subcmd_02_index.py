"""test_subcmd_02_index.py

Test index subcommand for pyani

The test suite is intended to be run from the repository root using:

nosetests -v

Individual test classes can be run using, e.g.:

nosetests -v tests/test_subcmd_01_download.py:TestDownloadSubcommand

Each command CMD available at the command line as pyani <CMD> is
tested in its own class as a subclass of unittest.TestCase, where
setUp() defines input/output files, a null logger (which is also
picked up by nosetests), and a dictionary of command lines, keyed
by test name, with values representing command-line options.

For each test, command line options are defined in a Namespace and
passed as the sole argument to the appropriate subcommand.
