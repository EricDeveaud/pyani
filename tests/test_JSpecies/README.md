# README.md - `test_JSpecies`

## Overview

This directory contains output data from [JSpecies version 1.2.1](http://imedea.uib-csic.es/jspecies/download.html), as applied to the four FASTA files located in `../test_ani_data`: 

* `NC_002696.fna`
* `NC_010338.fna`
* `NC_011916.fna`
* `NC_014100.fna`

## Files

* `jspecies_results.tab`: ANI tables saved from the JSpecies GUI.
* `NC_002696_1020_vs_NC_010338_JSpecies.tab`: legacy BLASTN tab-separated (-m 8) output for one of the JSpecies comparisons. The `.blast` tables written into `pyani_tests` by JSpecies are not the native BLAST output. This file is provided for comparison purposes.
* `pyani_tests`: directory containing output files generated by JSpecies during the analysis.
