Contributing code or documentation
----------------------------------

We gratefully accept code contributions, if you would like to fix a bug,
improve documentation, or extend ``pyani``. To make everyone's lives easier
in this process, we ask that you please follow the procedure below:

1. Fork the ``pyani`` `repository`_ under your account at `GitHub`_.
2. Clone your fork to your development machine.
3. Create a new branch in your forked repository with an informative name like ``fix_issue_107``, using ``git`` (e.g. with the command ``git checkout -b fix_issue_107``).
4. Make the changes you need and commit them to your local branch.
5. Run the repository tests (see the :ref:`pyani-testing` documentation for more details).
6. If the tests all pass, push the changes to your fork, and submit a pull request against the original repository.
7. Indicate one of the ``pyani`` developers as an assignee to review your pull request when you submit your pull request.

The assigned developer will then review your pull request, and merge it or continue the conversation, as necessary.
